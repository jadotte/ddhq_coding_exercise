# DDHQ Coding Exercise - Ashton Jadotte

Here's my coding exercise submission. This is a simple page with a text area and a submit button that generates a png of a bar plot of the 20 most common bigrams in the submitted text. I used React and Next.js for the frontend and Python3 with Flask for the backend.

Both the frontend and backend can be run locally by entering the following commands from the parent DDHQ directory.

Flask Python backend run
> python3 flask_server/server.p

While the backend is running from another terminal pane run React frontend using:
> npm run --prefix ./ddhq-demo dev

the localhost link to open the app should output from the terminal





## Copied Text
> Developer Candidate Coding Exercise
> This is a coding exercise to assess your ability to build a small full-stack app.
> Requirements:
> Build an app that can take an arbitrary block of text and display a histogram of the bigrams in that text.
> Constraints:
●the app must have a separate backend and frontend
●the backend can use any language
● the front end must use React, Vue, or Angular
> Deliverable:
> You may go beyond the basic requirements and add additional features.Please provide the source code and instructions to run locally. Feel free to ask questions - we want to see how you approach solving problems and your ability to explain your thinking.
> Follow up with us to set up a short call to present your work within one week of receiving this exercise
